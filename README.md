### STAY-EASE (API)

This repository hosts an API REST created using Node.js and Express.js, with MySQL backed by Sequelize as the ORM. The primary purpose of this API is to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for a lodging reservation platform.

The platform is designed with three distinct user roles:

-Guests: Users with limited access who can make lodging reservations and view their own bookings.

-Hosts: Users who can list their properties for rent, in addition to the functionalities of Guests. They have the ability to add new rental properties, manage their bookings, and oversee property rentals.

-Administrators: Users with full privileges in the platform, capable of performing any CRUD operation on all entities and having complete access to system information and functionalities.

This project is still under development, and additional features and improvements are planned for future updates.
